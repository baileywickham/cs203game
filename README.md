# Project

The goal of this repo is to provide some sort of source control to the 203 game/project as I go. One of the problems with the system is that the grading system is that it is not backwards compatible, yet the changes we make move forward with us. So if we work up till project six but don't pass all of the project two tests, then we have to move those changes along the branches.

## Branches
Branches will be used as source control, with each branch corasponding to a single turn in.
