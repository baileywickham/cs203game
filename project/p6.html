  <h1>Class Project Assignment 6, CSC 203</h1>
</div>

<p>
For this assignment you will modify the virtual world to support a
"world-changing" event.  This event is to be triggered by a mouse press.
When the mouse button is pressed at a location on the screan, it should
affect the tiles near to the button press. The event must be shown
in the virtual world by changing
the affected background tiles and by modifying the affected entities
(more below).  In addition, the world event must create a new type
of entity.
</p>

 <h2>Objectives</h2>
 </div>
 
<ul>
<li>Add new functionality to existing code base demonstrating an
understanding of the exisiting design and functionality.
<li>Evaluate the current design based on the experience of
adding to the code 
</ul>

<h2>Concurrent Modification Exception</h2>
</div>

<p>
One thing to watch out for is a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html">java.util.ConcurrentModificationException</a>.
This exception can be generated if you attempt to modify a collection,
like a set, while you
are iterating over that same collection.  This could happen, for example, 
if you attempted to make a modification to the set of entities while you are
iterating over that set.
<p>
There are several ways to solve this problem.  In this case, one reasonable
solution is to refrain from adding to or removing from the set during
iteration.  Instead, you can defer any modification of the set until
the iteration is finished.  This can be done by creating an action or an
event to perform the modification, once the iteration is finished.  That
action needs to be stored on a list of pending work, and processed once
the iteration is complete.
<p>
Another reasonable
solution is to simply copy all of the elements of the set into an 
<code>ArrayList</code>, 
and iterate over the list.  This is a fairly standard technique, except
when dealing with very large sets.  For example, consider the following code:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>void modifyList(Set&lt;Something> theSet) {
    ArrayList&lt;<Something> copy = new ArrayList(theSet);
    for (Something s : copy) {
        if (I don't like s) {
            theSet.remove(s);
        }
        if (I want to add something to the set) {
            Something newElement = ...
            theSet.add(s);
        }
    }
}</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If we were to iterate directly over the set, we would not be able to add
and remove elements during the iteration.

<h2>World Changing Event: Detecting a Mouse click</h2>
</div>
<p>
Spritely defines a mechanism for detecting a mouse click:
<a href="http://spritely.jovial.com/javadocs/edu/calpoly/spritely/SpriteWindow.html#setMouseClickedHandler-edu.calpoly.spritely.MouseClickedHandler-"><code>SpriteWindow.setMouseClickHandler()</code></a>.
It takes a parameter of a type that is a functional interface, so added a
callback is straightforward.
<p>
In text mode, Spritely even provied a mechanism to simulate a mouse
click.  If you have added a mouse click handler to your
<code>SpriteWindow</code>, it will tell you that you can simulate
a mouse click by pressing the "m" key.  If you're running in text mode,
give it a try!
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>World Changing Event: Visualization</h2>
</div>

<p>
Decide on a world-changing event, like a river spawning, a volcano erupting,
or a rainbow being cast across the land.  This event must be triggered
by a mouse-click and must affect at least 7 background tiles of the world 
in proximity to the mouse position when the click occurs, unless the click
occurs at the edge of the world.  Note that background
tiles might be obscured by an entity, so there might be a visible change in
fewer than 7 tiles.  The event should affect no more than half of the world.

<p>
The world event must be shown by modifying the background image associated
with the affected tiles.  You are free to modify them however you would
like, and are encouraged to be creative.  Remember that the size of a
tile in pixels is given by <code>TILE_SIZE</code>.  You can download new
images to use in tiles, or you can use one of the unused images that came
with the initial project code.  If you download a new image, make sure the
file name doesn't conflict with an existing image.  Make sure you check
in any new images; you'll need a special git command to do this.  This
is described under <i>Submission</i>, below.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>World Changing Event: Effect</h2>
</div>

<p>
At least one type of existing mobile entity (e.g., miners or blobs)
must be affected by the world event, if it is close enough to the event
location.  This entity should change in appearance and behavior.

<p>
For example, a rainbow might change nearby miners into fairies that seek
out crystals.  Or the event might make the blacksmith start to move,
while maintaining the minerâ€™s prior behavior of bringing ore to a blacksmith.


<div class="header">
<h2>World Changing Event: New Entity</h2>
</div>

<p>
The world event must cause a new type of mobile entity to spawn.  This
new entity should animate and move according to logic defined by you.

<p>
For instance, the new entity might seek out blobs to turn them into 
crystals, chase down miners to infect them with the plague, or travel
the world spreading apple seeds.
<p>
Further, the new entity must move differently than the existing entities,
with at least some diagonal motion.  Think about how to use the A* pathing
algorithm effectively with your new entity movement.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> This new entity is in addition to the entity transformation
triggered by the event as just discussed.

<div class="header">
<h2>Description</h2>
</div>

<p>
Include a text file named <code>WORLD_EVENT.txt</code> in the <code>doc</code>
directory of your submission that
describes 1) how to trigger the event, 2) what should happen when the
event is triggered, 3) what the affected entities should do, and 4) what
the new entity is and how it should behave.

<div class="header">
<h2>Design</h2>
</div>

<p>
Be sure to adhere to the design principles discussed this quarter.
Refactor your code as needed, and resist the urge for quick hacks that
would increase maintenance costs.

<p>
You are encouraged to reflect on the quality of your design and the
effort required to add the functionality for this assignment.  How do
you think this effort compares to that needed to add the same functionality
to the originally given code?  Consider what would be required in the old
code to add a new entity whose movement is quite different than the original
set of entities.

<div class="header">
<h2>Submission</h2>
</div>

<p>
Submit your program in <code>turninXXX/p6</code> to GitHub 
by midnight on the due date.  Java source files should go in
<code>turninXXX/p6/src</code>, and your documentation file
should be in <code>turninXXX/p6/doc</code>.  You'll probably want to
copy your <code>run.sh</code> file and the <code>images</code> directory to
<code>turninXXX/p6</code>, so you can do your work directly there.
<p>
If you need to submit image files, you will need to use a special command
to add them.  That's because the file 
<code>turninXXX/.gitignore</code> is configured to ignore image
files.  In order to add an image file to your repository anyway, use
the "force" option in to the add command, <code>git add -f</code>.  For
example, to commit the file <code>images/chupacabra.png</code> to your
repo, type:
<blockquote><pre>git add -f images/chupacabra.png</pre></blockquote>.
After you have added the file, you can commit and push as normal.  It
would be a good idea to use the "-run" option of <code>checkgit</code> - even
in text mode, your program loads the images, and will fail if it doesn't
find one.
<p>
If you'd like to submit the assignment one day late with a penalty of 5%, 
add a file called <code>late_5_percent_off.txt</code> to the 
<code>p6</code> directory.  If you'd like to submit the assignment two 
days late with a penalty of 15%, add a file called
<code>late_15_percent_off.txt</code> to the <code>p6</code>
directory.  Make sure you add and push the late file.
<p>
After your code is working and submitted,
check your submission using the <code>checkgit</code> command on the
unix server.  If the autograder can't find your files for a reason that
is caught by <code>checkgit</code>, you will get a zero on the assignment.  To
check your submission, on a Unix server type:
<blockquote><pre>checkgit &lt;git-login> 203 p6</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If it works, you will see the message "** Tests Passed **".  If not,
you will see some kind of error message.  The error message might not tell
you exactly what you need to change, but it should give an indication as
to what is wrong.
