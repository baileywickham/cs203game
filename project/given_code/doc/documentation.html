See the file <code>classes.graphml</code> for an illustration of
the classes in this program.  This initial design uses Java classes
as "dumb" data structures, much like the data types that were all we
had before the advent of object-oriented programming.  This kind of
data structure was called a "struct" in C, a "record" in Pascal.
<p>
One oddity you will note is that angle brackets in Java type names are
replaced with square brackets in static members.  That's an artifact of 
the yed editor.  The UML notation for a static member is to underline
the name, and the only way to do this in yed is to use HTML for the
list of members.  It's inconvenient to put a "&lt;" in HTML -- you have to
type "&amp;lt;" -- so instead, we just use "[" and "]" where Java uses
angle brackets ("&lt;" and "&gt;").
<p>
The documentation here and in the code is pretty thin.  This is mostly
intentional - the idea is to show you how hard it can be to untangle
a moderate-sized program that's written in a procedural style.  Over the
course of the quarter, you'll re-write this in a more object-oriented
style.  You'll probably add documentation along the way, but one of the
points of the class is how OO code is easier to read, even when it
has sparse documentation.  You'll apply OO ideas like encapsulation,
loose coupling and polymorphism in order to make the code clearer, and
you'll chose simpler and easier-to-understand names for things in a
way that's made possible by polymorhphism.
