  <h1>Class Project Assignment 1, CSC 203</h1>
</div>

<p>
CSC 203 is structured around a class project.  The project is a
graphical simulation of a virtual world, where graphical entities
move around on a grid.  The main moving entities are miners, who seek
out ore.  When a given miner gets enough ore, it seeks out a
blacksmith, where it unloads the ore.  It then seeks out more ore.
This virtual world was named "Minecraft 2, Electric Boogaloo" in a
vote by the Spring 2018 CSC 203 class, beating out the name
"Mine 'n Dash."  You are welcome to change the name of your version
of the program.
<p>
You are provided with an initial version of this program.  It works,
but it's unfinished.  It's also been written in a non object-oriented,
purely procedural fashion.  As we explore object-oriented programming
and design, you will restructure this code so that it's easier to understand,
maintain and modify.  You will also progressively add functionality to
the program.
<p>
The initial version of the program is in the <code>procedural</code>
directory.  You can compile and run the program by typing 
<code>./run.sh</code> in that directory if you're on Linux or Mac, or 
by typing <code>wrun.cmd</code> on Windows.  Invoke it with </code>-help</code>
for a list of options.  It will run in graphical mode if it can, or in
text mode if a graphics screen isn't available.  Typically, a graphical
screen won't be available if you're logging into a Unix server using
ssh.  When the program runs in graphics mode, it should look like this:
<p>
<center><img src="html_images/p1_graphical.png"></center>
<p>
For text mode, you'll need to make your screen slightly larger
than 80x24 characters.  Letters are used to represent the different
characters:  miners are represented with alternating "m" and "M" characters,
ore is represented with "$", a blacksmith with "B", etc.  In text mode,
the simulation will look like this:
<p>
<center><img src="html_images/p1_text.png"></center>
</p>
<div class="header">
  <h2>Compiling and Running the Provided Code</h2>
</div>
<p>
To start, take a look at <code>run.sh</code>, or if you're running on
Windows, <code>wrun.cmd</code>.
<code>run.sh</code> is the more sophisticated of the two.  It's a
"bash script."  Bash, the "Bourne Again Shell" is a text-based command
interpreter developed on Unix; you can read more about it at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)</a> if
you're curious.  A bash script is just a collection of bash commands in a file.
We're not learning bash programming in this class, but it's tedious to 
manually type the commands to compile and run a Java program.  This script
was provided for you, so you can easily compile and run the program.  You 
may need to modify it slightly for your
computer.  It does the following:
<ul>
<li>It changes directory to the main program directory.
<li>It checks for the environment varialbe MATERIALS_DIR_203, a variable
    that holds the path to where you checked out the materials directory.
    It uses this to find the two libraries used by the program.  You need
    set an environment variable called MATERIALS_DIR_203 to
    contain the path of your materials directory.  See
    <code>info/setup.txt</code> in the materials directory for more
    information on this.
<li>It sets the variable LIBS to refer to the two libraries we use,
    <a href="https://spritely.jovial.com">Spritely</a> and 
    <a href="https://testy.jovial.com">Testy</a>.  Copies of the
    compiled libraries and their documentation is in
    <code>materials/lib</code>.
<li>It runs the java compiler, <code>javac</code> on the program source
    files in <code>src</code>.  This converts the <code>.java</code>
    source files into </code>.class</code> files, which are stored
    in the directory <code>out</code>.  <code>javac</code> is invoked
    with arguments that cause it to apply stricter correctness checks
    than is the default (<code>-Xlint:unchecked</code>).  The default
    behavior is good when compiling old code, but stricter checks are
    better when writing new code, because it will catch more errors for you.
    The compiler is also invoked with an option to limit the number of
    errors it reports to five (<code>-Xmaxerrs 5</code>), so that
    you're not forced to scroll through too much compiler output when
    things go wrong.
<li>It sets up the Unix environment so that your Java program can receive
    input one keystroke at a time, rather than having it be forced to
    wait until you type a complete line.  Further, it sets things up
    to restore the environment to the normal behavior, even if you abort
    the program with ^c (control-c).
<li>It runs your program with the <code>java</code> command, starting
    with the class <code>Main</code>, searching for code to load in the
    libraries and the <code>out</code> directory.  Any command-line
    options you specify are forwarded to java ("<code>$*</code>").
    A java language feature called "assertions" is enabled with
    <code>-ea</code>.
</ul>
<p>
Before continuing, make sure you can compile and run the provided code.
You can set up your computer to run it locally if you like.  See
<code>materials/info/setup.txt</code> for more information about this.

<div class="header">
  <h2>Understanding the Provided Code</h2>
</div>
<p>
When you run the program, it starts by executing the static method
<code>Main.main()</code>.  Take a look at <code>Main.java</code>.  In this
program, it just processes the command-line arguments, and then invokes
the static method </code>VirtualWorld.runSimulation()</code>.  From
there, you should be able to read through what the code does.  There are
some comments in the code, but there aren't many.  Figuring out what
the code does is part of the assignment.  It is hoped that by the end
of the class, you'll see why it's easier to understand code that's written
in a well-structured, object-oriented fashion, even in the absence of
extensive documentation.
<p>
As mentioned earlier, this program uses two libraries,
<a href="https://spritely.jovial.com">Spritely</a> and 
<a href="https://testy.jovial.com">Testy</a>.  Take a moment to
read through the documentation for these libraries.  In the provided
code, it's easy to tell when the code is using a class from a library,
because all of the import statements are explicit.  For example,
in <code>VirtualWorld</code>, various classes from Spritely are
used, but each is imported explicitly at the beginning of the file,
rather than using a wildcard import 
(<code>import edu.calpoly.spritely.*</code>).  Many Java style guides
recommend <i>against</i> using wildcard imports for this very reason.
<p>
You should set up bookmarks for the Spritely documentation and the Testy
documentation, which are in <code>materials/libs</code>.  You
should also set up a bookmark for the JDK 1.11 API documentation,
which is available at
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html">https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html</a>.  
You can also download a local copy
of the JDK 1.8 javadocs is you wish.
<p>
Before you get started with the project, spend some time reading through
the code.  Look up the documentation for the library classes it
uses, especially those in the Java standard library.  Also, spend some
time reading up on the basic unix commands, in
<code>materials/info/unix_commands.txt</code>  Make sure you understand
how to use <code>grep</code> -- it will come in especially handy as you
begin to distribute code around in multiple files.

<div class="header">
  <h2>Reading the UML diagram</h2>
</div>
<p>
There is a graphical diagram in the file 
<code>procedural/doc/classes.graphml</code>.  You can view and modify it with
the <code>yed</code> graph editor - see <code>info/setup.txt</code> in
the materials directory for information about installing yed.  If you're
in the lab, you can launch it with the command <code>yed</code>.
<p>
Selecting a class diagram, right-clicking, and then selecting the 
Properties option will open a dialog window to allow editing the 
class diagram. Selecting the UML tab will then allow editing the 
lists of attributes and methods.  This dialog window can be resized.
Please take a moment to load the given digram into yEd and take a look 
at the general structure of the provided code. We will be using this 
code base for the rest of the quarter.  See also the description
in <code>procedural/doc/documentation.html</code>.

<div class="header">
  <h2>Part 1:  Finish <code>EventSchedule</code></h2>
</div>
<p>
When you ran the program, you probably noticed a number of TODO messages
being printed out.  These came from the source code in 
<code>EventSchdule.java</code>.  There are three methods in this class that
are not implemented.  The behavior of each is specified in a comment before
the method.  In part 1, your taks is to replace the print statement with
a correct implementation in each method.  <em>Do not change the method name,
arguments, or return type.</em>
<p>
<code>EventSchedule</code> is a class with two fields:  A <code>List</code>
called <code>pendingEvents</code>, and a double called <code>currentTime</code>.
Your implementation of the three incomplete methods uses the Java language
mechanisms you've learned, plus the methods of <code>List</code>.  You'll
note that the type of the list is <code>List&lt;Event&gt;</code>; this syntax
means it's a list that holds objects of type Event.  You'll learn how
to define your own generic classes that take type parameters later in the
class.
<p>
In order to know what you can to with a list, look at the javadocs,
at <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html">https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html</a>.  As you can see, the full name of the type is
<code>java.util.List</code>.  It  has a large number of methods, but you
just need to use simple ones, like <code>add()</code>, <code>get()</code>,
and <code>remove()</code>.  In a large professional software environment like
Java, it's normal for the libraries that you use to have many features you
don't need.  One of the skills you're learning is how to be selective when
you read documentation like this.
<p>
<b>Please do not immediately try to find the answer you need using a
search engine!</b>  Blindly doing an internet search might be fast, but
it's risky.  Often information you find is not applicable, or flat-out wrong.
A search engine can be a useful tool, but reading the official documentation
is a necessary skill.  
<p>
For this assignment, you might be annoyed by the fact that you're forced
to write relatively inefficient <i>O(n^2)</i> code 
in <code>EventSchedule</code>.
You should be!  As you learned in prior classes, there are more efficient
data structures for maintaining a queue of elements that is sorted from earliest
to latest, like or event schedule.  You will be addressing this in a later
assignment, once we've learned some more language constructs that are helpful
for this.
<p>
Once you have correctly implemented the three methods of
<code>EventSchedule</code>, the program should spring to life.  You'll see
that the miners animate and move at different rates.  Trace through the
code, starting from main, to see how this is all being set up.  All of the
activity is being coordinated through the <code>EventSchedule</code> class
that you just implemented!

<div class="header">
  <h2>Part 2:  UML for Code Refactoring</h2>
</div>
<p>
Your next task in this assignment is to modify the UML so that the 
<code>Functions</code> class is eliminated, and all of the
static methods
are made into appropriate methods for the various classes.  Most of them
should become instance methods.  For this first assignment, you're just
being asked to turn in the modified UML diagram.  However, in the next
assignment you'll be applying these changes to the code, and you're
welcome to do that now.  Either way, you'll need to read and understand
the existing code now.
<p>
<font color="red">WARNING:</font>  Not all sections of 203 are asked to
completely eliminate the functions class.  It's possible that tutors or other
resources might not know this.  Make sure you double-check the assignment
instructions if you ask someone for clarification; they might have done a
different assignment, or their memory might be off.
<p>
Note that good design is somewhat subjective.  Even so, for most of the
methods here, there is a single "correct" class into which the method should
be moved.  For a small number of methods, one could reasonably argue in favor
of a few different classes.  For example, there are multiple classes with which
one could reasonably associate the <code>adjacent</code> method.  Do your best
to make reasonable decisions based on the design discussion in lecture and
document these decisions in your design document.
<p>
There is one kind of method in <code>Functions</code> that deserves special
treatment:  Some of the <code>createXXX</code> methods.  Some of them create
different kinds of entities.  As such, they do belong with Entity, due to their
return type, not their parameter.  For now,
these methods should be left as static methods, but they should be moved
to Entity.

<h4 class="header">Access Modifiers</h4>
<p>
   With the exception of some constant (<code>static final</code>) values,
   and the class <code>Point</code>, 
   all data attributes should be <code>private</code> and, when possible,
   <code>final</code>.  It's OK for data holders like <code>Point</code> 
   to have public members, particularly when they are final.

<p>
   Methods should also be <code>private</code> unless <code>public</code>
   access is necessary (i.e., it is used outside of the defining class).
   For this assignment, every method should be either <code>private</code>
   or <code>public</code>.  In this course, we are not using Java packages,
   so Java's package-private access level is not meaningful.
<h4 class="header">Deliverables</h4>
<p>
You need to create an updated <code>classes.graphml</code> UML document
containing your updated design.  Make sure it's complete!  It should reflect
all of the changes you plan to make to the code, based on the planned
design changes.  You must also submit a
text design document.  In a text file, list each group of methods,
and a justification for why you put it where you did.
If you think the method could reasonably be placed in multiple classes, 
discuss what the alternatives are, the reason(s) why you made the choice you 
did, and the reasons(s) why the other place or places made sense.
<p>
Many of the methods fall into groups that all have the same justification.
It's OK to give a list of similar methods, and then give the justification
for the group once.
<p>
Please submit either a plain text file called <code>DESIGN.txt</code> or a
PDF file called <code>DESIGN.pdf</code>.  It's OK to store the original
word processor file in your repository too, but only <code>DESIGN.pdf</code>
or <code>DESIGN.txt</code> will be read.

<div class="header">
<h2>Identifying Methods</h2>
</div>

<p>
The provided source code uses objects to hold data; these objects have
no methods (no behavior).  Your task for this assignment is to identify
the behavior associated with instances of a class (that is, objects) and 
move this behavior from standalone functions to methods defined within the
class.  Remember that an instance method is <u>not</u> underlined in UML.
An instance method is automatically supplied with a reference to
the object that it operates on; for this reason, instance methods will
have one fewer argument than the original static method.
</p>

<p>
Reasonable steps for this assignment include:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      Run the program.  You can use <code>-fast</code>, <code>-faster</code>,
      <code>-fastest</code> on the command-line to increase the rate at which
      actions are executed.
   <li>
      Read the source code, starting from <code>Main.main()</code>.  
         You might even want to add print 
         statements at strategic points, to see if the code is working
	 the way you think it is.
   <li>
      View the provided UML diagram to see the name of each class and the
      data stored within instances of each class.
   <li>
      Identify methods that interact with the data stored within an object.
   <li>
      Match behavior to classes.
      <p>When looking for good matches of functions with classes, consider
         the following hints:
         <ul>
            <li>If the attribute of an object is accessed directly
                  via a dot (e.g., <i>entity.name</i>), then either
                  the function in which this access appears should be
                  defined in the object's class, or the access should be
                  done via an accessor method.
            <li>If a method determines its behavior based on the "kind"
                  (e.g., the the various values of <code>ActionKind</code> or
                  <code>EntityKind</code>)
                  of object it is manipulating, then this method should likely
                  be moved into that object's corresponding class (do not
                  introduce separate classes at this time).
         </ul>
   <li>
      <p>
         There are some methods that may remain as static methods, but
         that can be reasonably moved into another class.  These are often
         "utility" methods derived from decomposing a problem
         into simpler methods.
   <li>
      <p>Run the program to verify that it behaves as expected.
</ul>
<p>
In this assignment, you are not being asked to add any needed accessor
methods to the diagram.

<div class="header">
<h2>Submission</h2>
</div>

<p>
Submit your documents in <code>turninXXX/p1/doc</code> to GitHub 
by midnight on the due date.  
If you'd like to submit the assignment one day late with a penalty of 5%, 
add a file called <code>late_5_percent_off.txt</code> to the 
<code>p1</code> directory.  If you'd like to submit the assignment two 
days late with a penalty of 15%, add a file called
<code>late_15_percent_off.txt</code> to the <code>p1</code>
directory.  Make sure you add and push the late file.
<p>
After your diagram is finished and submitted,
check your submission using the <code>checkgit</code> command on the
unix server.  If the autograder can't find your files for a reason that
is caught by <code>checkgit</code>, you will get a zero on the assignment.  To
check your submission, on a Unix server type:
<blockquote><pre>checkgit &lt;git-login> 203 p1</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If it works, you will see the message "<code>** Tests Passed **</code>".  If not,
you will see some kind of error message.  The error message might not tell
you exactly what you need to change, but it should give an indication as
to what is wrong.
<p>
Read what <code>checkgit</code> is telling you!  If there is a problem with your
submission, it will print out an error message that should lead you to
understanding what's wrong.  It also prints out other helpful information,
like an analysis of your <code>classes.graphml</code> file.  One of the best
things you can do now to save time later is to read and understand the
diagnostic messages you get from tools like <code>checkgit</code> and
<code>javac</code>.
