  <h1>Class Project Assignment 4, CSC 203</h1>
</div>

<p>
In this assignment, we will finish most of the refactoring by using 
<b>abstract classes</b> to create an entity hierarchy.  Like an interface, an
abstract class introduces a new type:  variables and expressions can take
on the type of an abstract class.  Also like interfaces, you cannot directly
create an instance of an abstract class.  Abstract classes allow you to share
implementation between the supertype and the subtype, because they
allow you to define fields and method implementations in the supertype.  
This is distinct from interfaces, which are generally used only to declare 
methods.  (Under certain, somewhat limited circumstances, interfaces also
allow the definition of default method implementations, but the intent behind
this is very different than is the case with abstract classes, and we will
not be exploring default method definition for interfaces in this course.)
<p>
An abstract class allows you to share implementation code between different
concrete subclasses, by putting the implementation in a common supertype,
the abstract class.  This is called "implementation inheritance" when we
want to distinguish it from the more loosely-coupled form of subtyping
we get when we implement an interface.  Avoiding duplicate code is desirable,
however, doing it via implementation inheritance comes with a price:  The 
superclass/subclass relationship is a fairly tight form of coupling.  Often,
composition is a better choice (see, for example, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance</a>).  However, in this 
assignnent, we are focusing on inheritance.
<p>
In Java, a class can only have a single superclass.  Of course, the superclass
can itself have a superclass; there can be any number of ancestor classes, all
the way up to <code>java.lang.Object</code>.  Java's restriction of only one
superclass per class is motivated by pragmatism:  Languages that allow
multiple inheritance (multiple superclasses for a class) need complex rules
to govern this inheritance.  In practice, it has been found that multiple
implementation inheritance is almost never justified, so this capability
was deliberately left out of Java.
<p>
In a case like our entity hierarchy, the problem domain is intrinsically
hierarchical.  In a case like this, implementation inheritance is
appropriate:  By the nature of the problem being solved, various kinds of
entities are aleady fairly tightly copuled to their natural supertypes.  In
a case like this, it is structurally simpler to use implementation inheritance
than it is to use composition.
<p>
Abstract classes, then, allow us to refactor our code by introducing
supertype/subtype relationships, where supertypes also define implementation
that is common to all subtypes.  We will apply this technique to our
entities, and replace <code>EntityKind</code> with a hierarchy of entity
types.

<div class="header">
 <h2>Objectives</h2>
 </div>
 
<ul>
<li>Improve the project code.
<li>Identify where cohesion is low in an exisiting class design.
<li>Modify an exisiting UML diagram (adding abstract classes and interfaces 
    where needed to improve the overall code design in terms of cohesion).
<li>Create new classes and interfaces, and eliminate the need for
    for the enumerated type for <code>EntityKind</code>.
<li>Apply these changes to the Java code.
<li>Make design changes to a moderately large code base and 
    have the code still work.
</ul>


<div class="header">
<h2>Task Overview</h2>
</div>

<p>
We will focus on entities. We will make <code>Entity</code> abstract, and make
new concreate classes, one for each kind of entity enumerated
by <code>EntityKind</code>.  Please continue to call the top class in this
hierarchy <code>Entity</code>; this makes it possible for the grading program
to find it.
<p>
Once we have an entity supertype and eight concrete entity subtypes,
we'll examine
the entities for what they have in common, and introduce abstract classes
to capture shared implementations.  Refactor the code so that classes do
not inherit code or fields that they don't use.  The goal for this assignment
is to refactor the code so that:
<ul>
<li>There is no duplicate code.
<li>Classes do not inherit fields or method implementations that they 
    do not use.
<li>The rest of the code in the game is refactored so that it appropriately
    uses the new subtypes of <code>Entity</code> to improve the design.
<li>The <code>EntityKind</code> class is eliminated.
</ul>
<p>
Consider applying the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern">Template
Method Pattern</a> to further reduce duplicate code.

<p>
Completion of this assignment will consist of
</p>
<ul>
   <li>An updated UML document (still named <code>classes.graphml</code>).
   <li>Refactored java code.
</ul>

<h4 class="header">
Instance Methods
</h4>

<p>
Identifying duplicate code within instance methods will require careful 
examination of the code within the potentially duplicate methods.  As a 
start, the names and
parameters must generally match or be close, but the method implementation must 
be considered as well.  

<p>
Your refactoring should not abuse inheritance with regard to methods.
In particular, assume you have identified method <code>foo</code> as
common among three classes (<code>A</code>, <code>B</code>,
and <code>C</code>), but only two of them (<code>B</code> and <code>C</code>)
have the same implementation.  You should not promote one implementation
of <code>foo</code> (e.g., from <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>) to the
new parent class only to then redefine it in some subclasses (e.g., in
<code>A</code>).  Instead, you can, for example, define an abstract class (named
<code>Abby</code> for this example) with an abstract method
<code>foo</code>. <code>A</code> can extend <code>Abby</code> and define
its implementation of <code>foo</code>.  Another new abstract
class can also extend <code>Abby</code> to define the single implementation
of <code>foo</code> used by <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> (which then
extend this new class).
</p>

<p>
For this exercise, all data should be <code>private</code> or
</code>protected</code>.

<h4 class="header">
UML
</h4>

<p>
You are encouraged to begin this refactoring by updating your
UML document first, while looking at the code for method
implementations.  Doing so allows you to take advantage of the graphical aspects
of UML to immediately identify duplication and to quickly refactor by
injecting intermediate classes.  Experience with this project indicates
that the majority of duplication can be identified and refactored quickly
through this approach, which then gives you an initial plan for
the code modifications.  Focus on the most obvious duplications first.
<p>
Of course, you might discover further improvements after a first pass
with UML.  This is fine; go ahead and make the improvement, in both the code
and the UML.
As always, be sure to compile and test your program frequently, so that
if something goes wrong, it will be easy to find the problem!
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Source Code Refactoring</h2>
</div>

<p>
   Your refactoring should mirror the work that you do for your design
document (UML diagram).  Your refactoring must not add or remove any
program functionality.  The resulting program must work as before.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Getting Rid of <code>EntityType</code></h3>
</div>
<p>
The first step in refactoring is to make <code>Entity</code> abstract, and to
create eight concrete subclasses of <code>Entity</code>.  To start, these
subclasses can be empty, except for the constructor.  At this stage, the
constructor should just call <code>super(...)</code> with the arguments
required by entity; this will be refactored and made simpler later.
There should be one
subclass for each enum value in <code>EntityType</code>.  For consistency,
these classes must be called <code>Blacksmith</code>, <code>MinerFull</code>,
<code>MinerNotFull</code>, <code>Obstacle</code>, <code>Ore</code>, 
<code>OreBlob</code>, <code>Quake</code> and <code>Vein</code>.  
<code>checkgit</code> will check to make sure you use these names.  To
begin the refactoring, make these eight subclasses, make <code>Entity</code>
abstract, and adjust the rest of the code as needed.  Then, compile and
run the program, and make sure it still works.  Of course, you'll want to break
this task up into multiple steps, where you build and run the program after
each step.
<p>
Next, you can get rid of code in Entity that does something different for
different <code>EntityKind</code> values, typically using a switch statement.
You can do this by declaring the method as abstract in Entity, and by overriding
it where it is needed in other classes.  This process might help you to arrive
at a good hierearchy of abstract classes.
<p>
After this, you can get rid the remaining uses of the <code>EntityType</code> 
enum.
In the given code, values of the <code>EntityType</code> enum are sometimes
passed as arguments to functions.  When you get rid of <code>EntityType</code>,
you can instead pass a function that identifies the right type of
entity.  You need a function that accepts one argument of type 
<code>Entity</code>, and that returns a boolean value.  Java defines
a functional interface for this:  <code>java.util.functions.Predicate</code>;
you can make a <code>Predicate&ltEntity></code>.
<p>
In order to use this predicate, you can use a lambda.  The body of the
function can determine if its argument is the type you want using
<code>instanceof</code>.  For example, <code>findNearest</code> is 
a method that takes an <code>entityKind</code>.  Your goal is to change
calls to this method so they look like this:
<blockquote><pre>    Blacksmith b = (Blacksmith) w.findNearest(pos, (Entity e) -> e instanceof Blacksmith);</pre></blockquote>
<p>
To make this improvement for <code>findNearest</code>, consider following 
these steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
   Rename <code>findNearest()</code> to <code>oldFindNearest()</code>,
   then compile and run your code.
<li><p>
   Add a new <code>findNearest()</code> method that doesn't take an argument
   of type <code>Class</code>.  Instead, have it take a functional interface
   instance, for a function that takes an <code>Entity</code> instance and
   returns a boolean.  <code>java.util.function.Predicate&lt;Entity></code>
   will work beautifully here.  A good name for this parameter might
   be <code>isTarget</code>, since it's a function that determines if a given
   entity satisfies the criteria to be a target.
<li><p>
   In the body of <code>findNearest()</code>, use the predicate
   when the method needs
   to test if an entity satisfies the condition that was passed in to it.
   Compile your code.
<li>
   <p>
   Find one place where <code>oldFindNearest()</code> is called.  Change it
   to the new <code>findNearest()</code>, using a lambda as described
   above.
<li>
   <p>
   Compile and test your code.
<li>
   <p>
   Repeat the previous two steps until all calls to <code>oldFindNearest()</code>
   are eliminated.  Remove <code>oldFindNearest()</code>.
</ol>
<p>
When you're done, you should be able to remove <code>EntityKind.java</code>
HINT:  <code>grep</code> is a great tool for searching for places in your
code where a certain type is used.

<h3>Tips on Refactoring Methods</h3>
</div>

<p>
There are some methods from the orginal given code that contain
duplicate code that isn't immediately obvious.
Consider the following tips for refactoring the less obvious duplications.
This should be done after the initial refactoring (both in UML and in the 
code base) of the more obvious duplications so that there is less code 
to consider.
</p>

<ul>
   <li>For two methods that appear to be doing roughly the same thing, but
         that differ slightly in their implementation:  Examine the code
         to determine if the code can be rewritten to match.  This 
         requires careful consideration for what each method does (and does
         <em>not</em> do) to avoid introducing bugs.
   <li>
      Some methods may have the same general structure (and match
         identically in significant portions), but differ in some
         segments.  For such methods, the general structure and identical
         portions can be refactored into a parent class.  This parent class
         will declare new <code>protected abstract</code> method(s) that
         each subclass then implements to define the unique behavior.
</ul>
<p>
This is an application of the 
Consider applying the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern">Template
Method Pattern</a> to further reduce duplicate code.

<div class="header">
<h3>Other Code Improvements</h3>
</div>
<p>
With this code restructuring, you should consider moving static fields
from other classes into the <code>Entity</code> hierarchy, if appropriate.  
If a static field can be made private, with only a static setter method for
initialization, it should be.
<p>
Similarly, you might be able to move or eliminate static methods from other
classes.  If a method isn't providing any value, get rid of it!  Done right,
OO design should lead to code that is simpler, more robust, and more likely
to be correct.
<p>
Also see if you can find a way to simplify the Entity classes by eliminating
fields.  Any field whose value is identical for all instances of a given class
probably isn't necessary.
It's wasteful to have an instance data member of a class if it has the
same value for all instances of that class; better to share a single
static data member.

<div class="header">
<h3>Be Thorough!</h3>
</div>
<p>
One goal of this exercise is to eliminate code duplication wherever this
can be resonably done.  In some places, the amount of duplicate code 
eliminated might seem small.  In a larger program, these same techniques
would have a bigger payoff in terms of code saved, and in terms of
quality and maintainability of the program.  The purpose of this exercise
is to understand these techniques for achieving code reuse, so go ahead
and apply them, even if the actual amount of duplicate code eliminated
is small.

<div class="header">
<h3>Improving <code>EventSchedule</code></h3>
</div>
<p>
As noted in project assignment 1, your initial implementation of 
<code>EventSchedule</code> wasn't very efficient.  Each time you look for
the earliest event, you needed to do a scan of the entire list.  Now
that you are familiar with comparators, it's easy to fix this, by using
an appropriate data type.
<p>
The Java library has the perfect type for this need:
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/PriorityQueue.html">
<code>java.util.PriorityQueue</code></a>.  Replace your old 
<code>List</code> with a <code>PriorityQueue</code>, ordered by the event
time.  Be sure to check out the methods <code>peek()</code>,
<code>poll()</code> and <code>removeIf(...)</code>.  Your code will be
tested for efficiency.
<p>For this assignment, it's OK if
<code>EventSchedule.unscheduleAllEvents()</code> requires an
<i>O(n)</i> pass over the entire list -- <code>unscheduleAllEvents()</code>
is called relatively infrequently in this program.  If this weren't true,
you could maintain a map from each target to the set of events for that
target.  This would speed <code>unscheduleAllEvents()</code>, but it would
impose significant complexity, and extra overhead for the more common
operations of adding and removing events.  Since it's not clear if this would
even be a benefit, you are not being asked to do it.


<div class="header">
<h2>Submission</h2>
</div>

<p>
Submit your program in <code>turninXXX/p4</code> to GitHub 
by midnight on the due date.  Java source files should go in
<code>turninXXX/p4/src</code>, and your documentation file
should be in <code>turninXXX/p4/doc</code>.  You'll probably want to
copy your <code>run.sh</code> file and the <code>images</code> directory to
<code>turninXXX/p4</code>, so you can do your work directly there.
When you submit the files to github, the image files won't be uploaded;
git has been configured to ignore them, in the file 
<code>turninXXX/.gitignore</code>.
<p>
Make sure your UML diagram agrees with your code!
<p>
If you'd like to submit the assignment one day late with a penalty of 5%, 
add a file called <code>late_5_percent_off.txt</code> to the 
<code>p4</code> directory.  If you'd like to submit the assignment two 
days late with a penalty of 15%, add a file called
<code>late_15_percent_off.txt</code> to the <code>p4</code>
directory.  Make sure you add and push the late file.
<p>
After your code is working and submitted,
check your submission using the <code>checkgit</code> command on the
unix server.  If the autograder can't find your files for a reason that
is caught by <code>checkgit</code>, you will get a zero on the assignment.  To
check your submission, on a Unix server type:
<blockquote><pre>checkgit &lt;git-login> 203 p4</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If it works, you will see the message "** Tests Passed **".  If not,
you will see some kind of error message.  The error message might not tell
you exactly what you need to change, but it should give an indication as
to what is wrong.
<p>
The <code>p4</code> directory must contain at least the following files:

<ul>
<li><code>doc/classes.graphml</code>
<li><code>src/Action.java</code>
<li><code>src/Blacksmith.java</code>
<li><code>src/Entity.java</code>
<li><code>src/Event.java</code>
<li><code>src/EventSchedule.java</code>
<li><code>src/EventTimeComparator.java</code>
<li><code>src/Main.java</code>
<li><code>src/MinerFull.java</code>
<li><code>src/MinerNotFull.java</code>
<li><code>src/Obstacle.java</code>
<li><code>src/Ore.java</code>
<li><code>src/OreBlob.java</code>
<li><code>src/Point.java</code>
<li><code>src/Quake.java</code>
<li><code>src/TestCases.java</code>
<li><code>src/Vein.java</code>
<li><code>src/VirtualWorld.java</code>
<li><code>src/WorldModel.java</code>
</ul>
