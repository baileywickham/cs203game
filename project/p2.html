  <h1>Class Project Assignment 2, CSC 203</h1>
</div>

<p>
This programming is the complement 
<a href="p1.html">Assignment 1</a>, where you made a UML diagram.
In this assignment, you'll be turning in the refactored code.  As
you refactor the code, you may want to change some of the decisions
you made in assignment 1.  That's fine, but keep your UML diagram in
sync with your code changes.

<div class="header">
<h3>Task Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>
You must identify the behavior associated with each class (i.e.,
the behavior exhibited by instances of the class) and move that behavior
from the standalone static methods in <code>Functions.java</code> to
methods defined within the class.  For this assignment, you will also
add a little bit of new functionality:  You'll finish up some work that was
left incomplete in the original program.  You also will need to add some
accessor and mutator methods.
<p>
As you write the code for assignment 2, you will likely be tempted to
change the UML diagram.  <b>Please do!</b>  It is normal to revisit
assumptions you made earlier in the process.  This is how a design gets
better over time.  When you make such a change, be sure to keep your
diagram in sync.  Your diagram will be checked to see if it agrees with
your code.
<p>
<font color="red">WARNING:</font>  Not all sections of 203 have the same
assignments.  It's possible that tutors or other
resources might not know this.  Make sure you double-check the assignment
instructions if you ask someone for clarification; they might have done a
different assignment, or their memory might be off.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
</div>

<ul>
<li>To be able to read and understand java code in terms of methods and class instances
<li>To be able to identify and convert static methods into instance methods to better associate computation with data
<li>To be able to translate your code design from UML into refactored Java code
<li>Specifically, for this assignment, in the actual java code, move all static methods in the file <code>Functions.java</code> to the appropriate classes.
<li>To be able to make design changes to a large code base and have the code still work
</ul>

<div class="header">
<h2>Source Code Refactoring</h2>
</div>

<p>
You must refactor the methods from the <code>Functions</code> class
to move them into the appropriate classes as previously discussed.  As
each method is moved, you will need to make modifications to the code
that uses the method.  Your refactoring should mirror the work done for 
your design document (UML diagram) augmented with what you've learned 
since then.

<p>
Your refactoring must not add or remove any functionality.  Your
refactoring may add accessor/mutator methods, but only as needed.
The resulting program must work as before.

<p>
It is not sufficient to simply move the static methods from
<code>Functions</code> to the other classes and then continue to invoke
them as public static methods.  For instance, if you determine that a
method works primarily on data within an <code>Entity</code> object, then
the method must be made non-static and the explicit <code>Entity</code>
argument will be replaced by the implicit reference to <code>this</code>.  
This modification will necessitate appropriate changes to the invocation of
the method.

<p>
As an example, moving the following (fake) method into <code>Entity</code>
will change it as shown.

<blockquote>
   <pre>
      class Functions
      {
         public static void turnAround(Entity entity, int numRotations)
         {
            ... id ...   (this.id is also correct, but less common)
         }

         ...
            // invocation of turnAround
            turnAround(entity, 20);

      }
   </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
   becomes

<blockquote>
   <pre>
      class Entity
      {
         public void turnAround(int numRotations)
         {
            ... this.id ...
         }

         ...
            // invocation of turnAround
            entity.turnAround(20);

      }
   </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, when you refer to static methods that haven't been moved
out of <code>Functions.java</code> yet, you'll have to add
<code>Functions.</code> before the method call.  Then, when that method
moves to its new home, you'll have to change that call again.

<div class="header">
<h3>Tips on Refactoring Methods</h3>
</div>

<p>
First and foremost, only make one change at a time.  You should never be
more than five minutes or so away from a working version of your program.
Make your changes as small as they can, and then compile and run the program.
That way, if something goes wrong, you'll know that the problem is in
something you just changed.
<p>
When searching for where something is accessed, consider using the
<code>grep</code> command to search for a string across a number of
files.  See <code>info/unix_commands.txt</code> for a brief explanation.
Experienced programmers use <code>grep</code> all the time!

<p>
You can use the compiler to help
you with your refactoring.  In particular, as you make changes, the compiler
will flag now invalid uses of moved methods.  This serves two purposes.  The
first, and arguably most important, is gaining an understanding of the error
messages that the compiler reports and the reasons for such error messages.
Nobody enjoys seeing error messages, but quickly interpreting and addressing
such errors will improve your workflow.

<p>
The second purpose for using the compiler as an aid is that it can quickly
identify all parts of a code base affected by a change.  This is incredibly
beneficial when working with unfamiliar code.

<p>
   Consider the following more specific tips.
</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      Examine the data attributes in each class.  Draw a graph of dependencies
      between the classes (in the project) based on the data stored in each
      (e.g., <code>WorldModel</code> relies on <code>Entity</code>).  Start
      your refactoring by moving methods into those classes that depend on
      the fewest other classes.
   <li>
      In the class you are currently examining, you can temporarily change 
      the access modifier for a data attribute to <code>private</code>, and
      run the compiler.  This will gell you where other classes attempt
      to access the private attribute.
   <li>
      After moving a method and removing <code>static</code>, remove the
      target object from the parameter list, and change all uses within the
      method to <code>this</code>, eithher implicitly or explicitly.  Compile 
      the program to determine where the method was invoked.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
When you're done, <code>Functions.java</code> should contain an empty 
class.  When that happens, delete the file.

<h4 class="header">Other Static Methods</h4>
<p>
As you refactor the code, you may find other methods that can be moved
from one class to another, and made into instance methods.  For example,
this might be clearer than adding a new getter or setter, when a data member
is made private.  As you find other improvements like these, make them!

<h4 class="header">Access Modifiers</h4>
<p>
   With the exception of some constant (<code>static final</code>) values,
   and the class <code>Point</code>, 
   all data attributes should be <code>private</code> and, when possible,
   <code>final</code>.  When you make something private, you may need
   to add a getter and/or setter.  It's OK for data holders like <code>Point</code> 
   to have public members, particularly when they are final.

<p>
   Methods should also be <code>private</code> unless <code>public</code>
   access is necessary (i.e., it is used outside of the defining class).
   For this assignment, every method should be either <code>private</code>
   or <code>public</code>.  In this course, we are not using Java packages,
   so Java's package-private access level is not meaningful.
<p>
   <code>VirtualWorld</code> still has public static data members, and
   static functions.  We'll deal with this in a subsequent assignment.

<h2>Fixing a Bug</h2>
</div>
<p>
When you run the program, you might notice that the miners don't
change appearance when they become full.  That's because there's a bit
of unfinished work in the program.  Look in the <code>images</code>
directory.  You'll notice that there are a set of images called
<code>miner_full<i>n</i>.png</code>.  They add a white dot to the miner,
to indicate that it is full.  Once you've finished refactoring the code,
your next job is to finish this work.  Modify the program so that when
a miner becomes full, and starts seeking a blacksmith, it is rendered
with the appropriate image sequence.  For text mode, use the sequence
"mM$mM" to render a full miner.  When this is working, the
program will look like this:
<p>
<img src="html_images/p2_graphical.png">


<div class="header">
<h2>About Images, Repos and the Unix Server</h2>
</div>
<p>
If you feel ready, now would be a great time to get your computer set up,
instead of using the Unix servers or the lab machines.  It's faster, you
don't need to be connected to the network, and it lets you see the graphics.
You still need to run <code>checkgit</code> on the Unix server, but there's
no particular reason to main a repo there.  (Checkgit clones a copy of your
repo every time you run it).
<p>
If you are switching between computers, though, the easiest and most realiable
way to keep the two versions of turnin consistent is by using git.  When you
make changes on one computer, add, commit and push your changes there, and then
pull those changes on the other computer.
<p>
When you do this, you may notice that the image files don't get checked in.
That's intentional, because you don't need to change the images, and they're
somewhat large.  So, if you are using multiple computers, you'll have to
copy the <code>images</code> directory into each project in each copy of your
turnin repository, either using the <code>cp</code> command as previously
described, or by using your computer's file browser.

<div class="header">
<h2>Submission</h2>
</div>

<p>
Submit your program in <code>turninXXX/p2</code> to GitHub 
by midnight on the due date.  Java source files should go in
<code>turninXXX/p2/src</code>, and your documentation files
should be in <code>turninXXX/p2/doc</code>.  You'll probably want to
copy your <code>run.sh</code> file and the <code>images</code> directory to
<code>turninXXX/p2</code>, so you can do your work directly there.
When you submit the files to github, the image files won't be uploaded;
git has been configured to ignore them, in the file 
<code>turninXXX/.gitignore</code>.
<p>
If you'd like to submit the assignment one day late with a penalty of 5%, 
add a file called <code>late_5_percent_off.txt</code> to the 
<code>p2</code> directory.  If you'd like to submit the assignment two 
days late with a penalty of 15%, add a file called
<code>late_15_percent_off.txt</code> to the <code>p2</code>
directory.  Make sure you add and push the late file.
<p>
After your code is working and submitted,
check your submission using the <code>checkgit</code> command on the
unix server.  If the autograder can't find your files for a reason that
is caught by <code>checkgit</code>, you will get a zero on the assignment.  To
check your submission, on a Unix server type:
<blockquote><pre>checkgit &lt;git-login> 203 p2</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If it works, you will see the message "** Tests Passed **".  If not,
you will see some kind of error message.  The error message might not tell
you exactly what you need to change, but it should give an indication as
to what is wrong.
<p>
The <code>p2</code> directory must contain the following files:

<ul>
<li><code>src/Action.java</code>
<li><code>src/ActionKind.java</code>
<li><code>src/Entity.java</code>
<li><code>src/EntityKind.java</code>
<li><code>src/Event.java</code>
<li><code>src/EventScheduler.java</code>
<li><code>src/Point.java</code>
<li><code>src/VirtualWorld.java</code>
<li><code>src/WorldModel.java</code>
<li><code>doc/classes.graphml</code>
</ul>
