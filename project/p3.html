  <h1>Class Project Assignment 3, CSC 203</h1>
</div>

<p>
In the first pair of assignments you identified methods and moved them
into the most approprite classes.  In doing so, you may
have noticed that some classes support functionality that
are not appropriate for all instances of the class.  In other words, some
of the methods don't apply fo all instances of the class.  Moreover, these
classes support data attributes that is not used by all instances
of the class.

<p>
This is an issue of <em>cohesion</em>.  Specifically, these classes 
exhibit low (poor) cohesion by representing
multiple concepts together in one class.  This class combines all 
attributes and methods used by each of the different concepts.  The 
concepts they combine might be related,
but they're diffrenent enough that we can get better code by splitting
things up.  Tips for identifying classes with low cohesion
are given later.

<p>
This design and programming assignment
asks that you improve the code by splitting
classes exhibiting low cohesion into multiple highly cohesive classes.
Doing so requires you to identify common methods for
each subset of these new classes, and then introduce a new <b>interface</b>
for each logical grouping of these methods.  More on this below.
<p>
We'll also use interfaces to reduce coupling between modules.  That is,
instead of exposing a class to everything contained in another class, we'll
use <i>role interfaces</i> to reduce what is visible to that other class.
After having done that, we'll find that it's easier to extend the program
with new functionality.  We'll do just that, by adding a new animatable
background to the program.

<p>
In our refactoring, we're going to ignore one class for
now:  <code>Entity</code>.  This class has an obvious
problem with cohesion, and it needs to be split up, but we need a 
different tool to properly deal with
that.  For this reason, we'll be leaving <code>Entity</code> as one
big class, and keeping <code>EntityKind</code> this assignment.

<div class="header">
 <h2>Objectives</h2>
 </div>
 
<ul>
<li>Deepen your understanding of the large project code.
<li>Identify where cohesion is low in an exisiting class design.
<li>Modify an exisiting UML diagram (adding classes and interfaces 
    where needed to improve the overall code design in terms of cohesion).
<li>Create new classes and interfaces, and eliminate the need for
    for the enumerated type for <code>ActionKind</code>.
<li>Apply these changes to the Java code.
<li>Make design changes to a moderately large code base and 
    have the code still work.
</ul>


<div class="header">
<h2>Task Overview</h2>
</div>

<p>
You must identify those classes with low cohesion and then split these
classes into separate classes exhibiting high cohesion.  When you do
this in a program, each of
these new classes introduces a separate type.
You then typically need to have a single supertype for these new types,
so that there is a common Java type for code that use your types.
A Java interface is a good tool for this, when the two subtypes
share very little.

<p>
Based on the original source code, if you distributed your methods
well in the previous assignment, the principal location where there
is low cohesion is those classes that depend on <code>ActionKind</code>
or <code>EntityKind</code>.  We're leaving <code>EntityKind</code> alone
for now, but it will be eliminated in the next assignment.
<p>
The original source code uses <code>ActionKind</code> and
<code>EntityKind</code> to allow each <code>Action</code> instance
and each <code>Entity</code> instance to play one of potentially many
roles.  As a starting point of your refactoring, you are to eliminate 
<code>ActionKind</code>.  When you do this, and you use polymorphism,
you will find that the method names become simpler.  Please keep the
name <code>Action</code> for the common supertype of objects that
represent some kind of action; this makes it possible for the grading
program to find this type.
<p>
As a next step, consider the class that you created for instances that were
<code>ActionKind.ANIMATION</code> in the old code.  You will notice that it
has the field that used to be <code>Action.entity</code>, of type 
<code>Entity</code>.  But how much does this action subclass need to know
about entities?  Very little, it turns out; it only uses a small subset of
the methods of </code>Entity</code>.  So, in keeping with the
Interface Segregaton Principle, fix this:  Define an interface that
expresses what your animation action needs to know about entities,
and have <code>Entity</code> implement this interface.  Then, make
the action depend only on this new interface, and not on <code>Entity</code>.
<p>
When you do this, you'll notice another part of the code that unnecessarily
depends on <code>Entity</code>.  Fix this too!  If that other module needs
to know even less about <code>Entity</code>, express that as a different,
smaller interface.  Remember, it's OK for one interface to inherit from
another, or to have a class that implements multiple interfaces.  It's 
also perfectly fine to have an interface that defines
a very small number of methods, or even none at all, if it makes the code
clearer and reduces coupling.
<p>
As you introduce these <i>role interfaces</i>, pick good names.  Remember,
a class name should be a noun.  Often, a role interfaces expresses the idea
"thing that you can do X to."  Something that can be activated is 
"Activatable," something that can be rendered is "Renderable," etc.  If you
can't find a good name, the suffix "-able" will often help.
<p>
As before, you are encouraged to develop both the UML design document and
the code refactoring at the same time. You are further encouraged to
implement the refactoring incrementally so that your refactored program
executes properly at each step. You will submit the design document and the
code together.

<div class="header">
<h3>Introducing Interfaces</h3>
</div>

<p>
The following are some tips on approaching the introduction of interfaces
to support splitting classes.
</p>

<p>An interface shouldn't have a method that isn't applicable
to all of the classes that implement that interface.  In more advanced
situations, it's not uncommon for the implementation of a method for certain 
types of objects (certain classes) to be "do nothing," but in this kind
of simple object decomposition, this should be extremely rare.  Further,
in cases like ours a class should not implement an interface and then define 
a method required by the interface that raises an exception indicating that 
the method is not supported.

<p>
Your introduction of interfaces for this project must
be meaningful.  It is insufficient to define a single interface with all
methods that are then only partially implemented by each of the classes.
<p>
In order to refactor incrementally, consider these tips:

<ul>
   <li>First, copy the original class to each of the new classes, and turn
       the original class into an interface.
   <li>Make the new classes implement the interface.
   <li>Adjust code that uses the old class, as needed.  For example, you'll
       need to change how instances are created.
   <li>Compile and run the program, and make sure it still works.
   <li>In each new class, eliminate each data attribute not used by
       the class and each method not supported by this class.  
   <li>Change the interface so it declares declaring only those
      methods shared by every new class.
   <li>Often, in the new class the implementation of the shared method will
      be to just call a more specific method.  Get rid of the more specific
      method name; just change the name of the method with the real
      implementation so that it matches the shared method signature.
   <li>Compile and run the program, and make sure it still works.
</ul>



<div class="header">
<h2>Design Document</h2>
</div>

<p>
Your "design document" will consist only of an updated UML diagram.
Copy the UML diagram from the prior design assignment to the directory
<code>p3/doc</code> in your turnin directory.

<p>
   You can add an <b>interface</b> to the UML document by adding a class
and then, under the <em>UML</em> tab in properties, setting the
<em>Stereotype</em> field to "interface".  For each interface that a class
implements, be sure to draw an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram#Relationships">
appropriate arrow</a> (dashed line with open triangle head) from the class
to the interface.  If an interface extends another interface in your design,
then be sure to connect them with an appropriate arrow (solid line with open
triangle head).  UML notation is also described on page 135 in your book.
<p>
<code>checkgit</code> will print out what your diagram indicates are the
supertypes of every type.  Make sure it tells you what you expect.  If you
use the wrong kind of arrow, or an arrow that points the wrong way,
paying attention to what <code>checkgit</code> says will catch the error
for you.  You will be graded on what you indicate in your diagram, and
there will be no resubmissions for errors that <code>checkgit</code> indicates.

<div class="header">
  <h2>Animating the Background</h2>
</div>
<p>
Now that the animation code isn't tied to <code>Entity</code>, you 
can more easily add
a new kind of animatable object to the program.  Your assignment in this part is
to animate the background, so that it gets brighter and darker over a
period of 30 seconds, when the program is run at normal speed.  You can
think of this as simulating daylight, with a very bright full moon
at night.  Here's
a portion of the world, during "night" and "day":
<p>
<center>
<img src="html_images/p3_night.png">
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="html_images/p3_day.png">
</center>

<p>
In order to achieve the effect of brightening the grass, you can take
advantage of a technique called "alpha blending."  In the darker image,
the grass tiles are left alone.  In the brighter image, a semi-transparent
yellow tile is drawn over each grass tile.  Be sure you read the Spritely
documentation, to see how to place a solid colored tile over an image tile.
<p>
"Alpha" is a measure of the
transparency of a color - for 
<code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html#Color-int-int-int-int-">java.awt.Color</a></code>,
an alpha value of 0 means the color is fully transparent, and a value
of 255 means it's fully opaque.
<p>
Take a look at the code where the background is drawn.  You'll see that it
uses Spritely's <a href="http://spritely.jovial.com/javadocs/edu/calpoly/spritely/AnimationFrame.html#addTile-int-int-edu.calpoly.spritely.Tile-"><code>AnimationFrame.addTile()</code></a>
to draw a single tile with the grass image in each square where the background
is grass.  You'll also note that <code>addTile</code> can be called multiple
times.  So, you can "brighten" grass by adding a semi-transparent tile 
that is yellow over the grass tile, and you can vary the amount of brightness
by adjusting the color value.  Spritely provides you with a type of tile
that is a solid color (which can, of course, be semi-transparent).
<p>
You will have to identify which objects in the background array are
grass tiles.  This might require communicating some information when
the world is set up, since it's the setup code that knows which background
tiles are which.
<p>
In order to make the animation happen, you need to make the class that
draws the background do something like what entity does.  You need it to
be called regularly -- once every 100ms of simulated time will
do nicely.  And a good way to gradually brighten and darken the image is to set
an alpha value according to a formula 
like <code><i>1.0 - 0.5 * cos(theta)</i></code>,
where theta varies between 0 and 2π with a period of 30 seconds.
<p>
When you do this, <i><b>should re-use the same class implementing
the <code>Action</code> interface that you created for animation of 
entities</b></i>.  There are other valid designs that achieve the same
effect, but you are being asked to re-use the same animation action that
you used for entities.  It might help to
create a new class whose sole job it is to vary the alpha of the tile you
overlay on the grass.  What interface(s) does this class need to implement?
Should you define a new interface?
<p>
Note that it's OK to change method names.  Indeed, it's often the case that
when you refactor code by introducing interfaces, a method name that used
to make sense is too specific, so you need to change it to something more
generic.  For example, the original <code>Functions.java</code> had a
method called <code>nextImage()</code>.  This describes the implementation
of the method, but it doesn't really explain the need the method fulfills.
A method name that describes what the method is <i>accomplishes</i>, rather
than how it accomplishes it is better, because it invites you to use the
same interface for classes where you need to accomplish the same goal, in
a different manner.  The old <code>Functions.nextFrame()</code> essentially
moved the internal representation of an entity forward in time in order to
perpare it to display the next frame.  It might help if you think of a
name that expresses this idea.
<div class="header">
  <h2><code>VirtualWorld</code> Refactoring</h2>
</div>
<p>
As a final bit of code cleanup, pay some attention to <code>VirtualWorld</code>.
In the given code, this class had all static members.  This works, but
it's jarring to have a lot of static methods and static state in a class.
It is true that there's only one virtual world that is simulated, so making
everything static works, but it's bad style.  One could
imagine simulating multiple words simultaneously, but even if this isn't
a priority, it's better to have instance members in a class that's
part of your simulation.  
<p>
With that said, it makes sense to have static members for things that are
constant.  For example, the different tiles that are loaded by
<code>VirtualWorld</code> would be the same, even if you had multiple
worlds running simultaneously.  In a case like this, you should split the
the initialization of <code>VirtualWorld</code> into a static part, and
a part for the instance.  The instance part goes in the constructor, but
what about the static part?  This is what Java <i>static initializers</i>
are for.  In a class definition, you can create a static initializer like
this:
<blockquote><pre>public class MyClass {
    public final String myString;
    public final String myString2;
    private int number;

    static {
        number = 1;
        myString = makeMyString();
        myString2 = makeMyString();
    }

    private static string makeAString() {
        return "string value number " + (number++);
    }

    ...

}</pre></blockquote>
<p>
You can put whatever computation you want inside this static initializer.
It is guaranteed to run before any code tries to access any of your static
data members, and before the constructor of the class runs.
<p>
You'll probably want to treat the tiles that hold the images of the grass and
the rocks more like the entity images, each with its own static data member.
<p>
It's OK to have constant static data members that are public.  Some
prefer to make them private, and create static accessor methods, but for this
kind of straightforward data holder, it's not necessary, nor particularly
helpful.  For consistency's
sake, <code>checkgit</code> will <strong>require</strong> that
<code>VirtualWorld</code> have the same static data members as before to
hold the different tile types.  However, such exposed
constant data members should be made so that they can't be changed.  But
what about the objects they refer to?  For the entity tiles, what about the
<code>List&lt;Tile&gt;</code> instances?  It is for a case like this that
Java supports immutable lists.  See 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#unmodifiableList-java.util.List-"><code>java.util.Collections.unmodifiableList()</code></a>.
<p>
You should make the static member that holds each list so that it can't
be changed, and you should also make the list so that it can't be changed.
But what about the <code>Tile</code> instances that are held within the list?
Can they be changed?  Investigate this, and make changes, if any are needed.
<p>
The grader will check for these fields, so please call them
<code>blacksmithTiles</code>,
<code>blobTiles</code>,
<code>minerTiles</code>,
<code>minerFullTiles</code>,
<code>obstacleTiles</code>,
<code>oreTiles</code>,
<code>quakeTiles</code>, and
<code>veinTiles</code>.

<div class="header">
  <h2>Animation Unit Test</h2>
</div>
<p>
One of the advantages of encapsulation is that it makes it easier to
write small unit tests, to test one part of the program.  Now that 
your animation action class don't
depend on the <code>Entity</code> type, you can write small,
stand-alone tests of just the functionality of scheduling
animation actions.
<p>
Specifically, you can write a new, dummy animation class that just counts up
how many times it's asked to update.  In a test method 
of <code>TestCases</code>,
you can also create an <code>EventSchedule</code> instance, and schedule
an animation action for your dummy animation.  Then, you can run
that scheduler up to a certain time value.  Next, you can write assertions
about how many times your dummy animation is called.
<p>
Write at least two independent unit tests that do this, 
in <code>TestCases.java</code>.  Call them from <code>TestCases.run()</code>.
Don't change the name of <code>TestCases.run()</code> -- the grading program
might call this method to check your work!  Write at least the following
unit tests, using <code>Testy</code>:
<ul>
<li>Write a test that creates an animation with a period of 1 ms, and a
    repeat count of 30.  Advance the event schedule from the beginning up to
    100 ms.  Verify that the animation was asked to update 30 times.
<li>Write a test that creates an animation with a period of 1 ms that is
    set up to repeat forever.  Advance the event schedule from the beginning 
    up to 100 ms.  Verify that the animation was asked to update 100 times.
</ul>

<p>
If you're ever unsure how some code works, a good way to explore it is to
write this kind of small, self-contained program that exercises the code.  
Instead of writing a program that you throw away, you can write a unit 
test.  In this way, the unit
test serves as a kind of documentation -- it expresses in code what some
other code is supposed to do.  It also gives you a valuable resource, because
if you ever change that code, you get some validation that it works correctly
"for free," by just running your unit tests.

<div class="header">
<h2>About Images, Repos and the Unix Server</h2>
</div>
<p>
If you feel ready, now would be a great time to get your computer set up,
instead of using the Unix servers or the lab machines.  It's faster, you
don't need to be connected to the network, and it lets you see the graphics.
You still need to run <code>checkgit</code> on the Unix server, but there's
no particular reason to main a repo there.  (Checkgit clones a copy of your
repo every time you run it).
<p>
If you are switching between computers, though, the easiest and most realiable
way to keep the two versions of turnin consistent is by using git.  When you
make changes on one computer, add, commit and push your changes there, and then
pull those changes on the other computer.
<p>
When you do this, you may notice that the image files don't get checked in.
That's intentional, because you don't need to change the images, and they're
somewhat large.  So, if you are using multiple computers, you'll have to
copy the <code>images</code> directory into each project in each copy of your
turnin repository, either using the <code>cp</code> command as previously
described, or by using your computer's file browser.

<div class="header">
<h2>Submission</h2>
</div>

<p>
Submit your program in <code>turninXXX/p3</code> to GitHub 
by midnight on the due date.  Java source files should go in
<code>turninXXX/p3/src</code>, and your documentation file
should be in <code>turninXXX/p3/doc</code>.  You'll probably want to
copy your <code>run.sh</code> file and the <code>images</code> directory to
<code>turninXXX/p3</code>, so you can do your work directly there.
When you submit the files to github, the image files won't be uploaded;
git has been configured to ignore them, in the file 
<code>turninXXX/.gitignore</code>.
<p>
If you'd like to submit the assignment one day late with a penalty of 5%, 
add a file called <code>late_5_percent_off.txt</code> to the 
<code>p3</code> directory.  If you'd like to submit the assignment two 
days late with a penalty of 15%, add a file called
<code>late_15_percent_off.txt</code> to the <code>p3</code>
directory.  Make sure you add and push the late file.
<p>
After your code is working and submitted,
check your submission using the <code>checkgit</code> command on the
unix server.  If the autograder can't find your files for a reason that
is caught by <code>checkgit</code>, you will get a zero on the assignment.  To
check your submission, on a Unix server type:
<blockquote><pre>checkgit &lt;git-login> 203 p3</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If it works, you will see the message "** Tests Passed **".  If not,
you will see some kind of error message.  The error message might not tell
you exactly what you need to change, but it should give an indication as
to what is wrong.
<p>
The <code>p3</code> directory must contain at least the following files:

<ul>
<li><code>doc/classes.graphml</code>
<li><code>src/Action.java</code>
<li><code>src/Entity.java</code>
<li><code>src/EntityKind.java</code>
<li><code>src/Event.java</code>
<li><code>src/EventSchedule.java</code>
<li><code>src/Main.java</code>
<li><code>src/Point.java</code>
<li><code>src/TestCases.java</code>
<li><code>src/VirtualWorld.java</code>
<li><code>src/WorldModel.java</code>
</ul>
