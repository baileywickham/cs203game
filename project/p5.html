  <h1>Class Project Assignment 5, CSC 203</h1>
</div>
<p>
For this assignment you must modify the algorithm used to determine the path
of all entities that move within the world.  This can be called their "pathing"
behavior.  Further, you will implement the pathing algorithm in an OO way, so
that it is decoupled from the specfic details of the miner program, and could
therefore be re-used in other contexts.  This decoupling will help you explore
how the algorithm works, and debug it, if necessary.
</p>

<div class="header">
 <h2>Objectives</h2>
 </div>
 
<ul>
<li>Modify the code to use the specified <code>PathingStrategy</code>
    interface.
<li>Integrate the use of this pathing strategy and understand the
    associated code example.
<li>Implement the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* pathing
    algorithm</a> in the exisiting code by implementing a 
    new class that implements the <code>PathingStrategy</code> interface.
<li>Create unit tests for your implementation of A*, and use them to explore
    improvements to the algorithm.
<li>Apply a debug framework to visualize the behavior of your code.
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
</div>

<p>
This assignment deviates from the pattern of previous assignments.  Though
this assignment does use some design strategies, the primary
goals are to improve the functionality of some entities in the virtual world,
and to explore the algorithm used to do that.

<p>
In particular, as you are likely aware by now, the movement of
the blobs and miners is not sophisticated.  You have likely seen an entity 
get stuck on an obstacle or on another entity.  You will improve the
pathing strategy in order to achieve a better result in this assignment.

<p>
Pathing algorithms are quite interesting, in and of themselves.  Our
exploration of pathing in this assignment also motivates the use of
some design patterns and techniques.  Applying these patterns will 
improve the flexibility of the implementation.  Further, they will
make it easier to used debugging and test frameworks, to better understand
the algorithm.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Replacing an Algorithm &mdash; Strategy Pattern</h2>
</div>

<p>
When an entity attempts to move, it needs to know the next step to take.
How that next step is computed is, in many respects, irrelevant to the code
within the corresponding entity.  In fact, we could imagine wanting
to change that
strategy for different builds of the program (to experiment), each time
the program is executed (based on configuration), or dynamically during
execution.  We could also imagine wanting to re-use an algorithm in a different
program.  Using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy 
pattern</a> allows you to separate out the pathing algorithm,
and easily substitute in a new algorithm as desired.

<p>
Your implementation must use the given
<a href="p5_given_code/src/PathingStrategy.java">PathingStrategy</a> interface without
modification.  A copy is given below.
</p>

import java.util.function.ToIntBiFunction;

{
    /**

     * of the end point.  This path is valid ("clear") when returned, but
     * may be invalidated in the future by the movement of other entities.
     * Element 0 of the returned list contains a point along the path one
     * step away from the start; the list may optionally contain more steps 
     * along the path.  If there is no path from start to goal,
     * a list of length zero is returned.

<p>
See <a href="p5_given_code/src"><code>p5_given_code/src</code></a> for additional code you can
incorporate into your project to help you complete this assignment.

<p>
This strategy interface declares a single method, <code>computePath</code>, to
compute at least the beginning of a path of 
points (returned as a list) from the start point to the
end point.  It also declares a second method for debugging purposes; see
<a href="p5_given_code/src/TestPathing.java"><code>TestPathing.java</code></a> to see how
that's used.
<p>
In order to compute this path, the pathing algorithm needs to know the
directions an entity can move.  This is provided to it with the functional
interface parameter 
<code>potentialNeighbors</code>.   In addition, in order to explore
potential paths, the algorithm must be able to determine if a
given point can be traversed.  In our program, this is true if the
point is both a valid position in the world and a location that is
not blocked.  This is provided to it by the 
<code>canPassThrough</code> functional interface argument.  Further,
it may wish to calculate the number of steps between two points,
via the <code>stepsFromTo</code> function.
The pathing algorithm will determine that a path is complete when 
a point is reached that is a neighbor of the
<code>end</code> point.
<p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Single-Step Pathing</h3>
</div>

<p>
As an example of defining a pathing strategy, consider the following
implementation of the single-step pathing algorithm,
<a href="p5_given_code/src/SingleStepPathingStrategy.java"><code>SingleStepPathingStrategy</code></a>.
This is the same algorithm as was implemented in the given code for
the class project.  You should use this as an initial pathing algorithm, as
you convert your program to the new interface.
</p>

<p>
Modify the appropriate entities to use a <code>PathingStrategy</code>.
Of course, you are encouraged to make one modification at a time, then
build and test!  Use the given
implementation to verify that your changes work.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.function.Function;
import java.util.function.Predicate;
import java.util.function.ToIntBiFunction;

    @Override
    public List&lt;Point> computePath(
                            final Point start, final Point end,
                            Predicate&lt;Point> canPassThrough,

    {
        ArrayList&lt;Point> result = new ArrayList&lt;>();

        // First, generate our list of neighbors, and see if the endpoint
        // is one of them.  If so, we're one move away from our goal.
        List&lt;Point> neighbors = potentialNeighbors.apply(start);
        if (neighbors.contains(end)) {

            // By our contract, we include neither the start nor the end 
            // point, so if we're within reach of the end, the correct
            // "path" is empty.
            return result;
        }

        // Now, see which of our neighbors moves us closer.
	int stepsAway = stepsFromTo.applyAsInt(start, end);
        for (Point neighbor : potentialNeighbors.apply(start)) {
            if (!canPassThrough.test(neighbor)) {

            } else if (neighbor.equals(start) || neighbor.equals(end)) {

                // Our "path" is only really one step toward the goal.  That's
                // OK, because our contract says it's the *prefix* of the
                // path.  A prefix can be just one step!
            }
        }
	// Nothing helps, so we return an empty path to indicate failure.
        return result;
    }

    @Override
    public void setDebugGrid(DebugGrid grid) {
	// Nothing much interesting to see here, so we don't use it.
    }
}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This implementation only matches the original pathing algorithm
if <code>potentialNeighbors</code> returns the same neighbor points, in the
same order as before.  You can experiment with different orders, or with
adding other points to the
<code>List</code> returned by <code>potentialNeighbors</code>.  For
example, you could allow diagonal movement, or even allow only diagonal
movement.  Each of these approaches can be tried
simply by changing the function passed to <code>computePath</code>.  You're
not required to do this, but feel free to experiment.  One of the nice things
about well-encapsulated code is that this kind of experimentation is simple,
and safe!
<p>
Before you integrate the this into your program, check out the
<code>TestPathing</code> program.  You should be able to run
<code>TestPathing</code> by adding your <code>Point</code> class to the
given code, but you can also easily integrate the tests in <code>TestPathing</code>
into your <code>Main</code> program.  A good way to do this is to modify 
<code>Main.java</code> to check for another command-line argument that
causes it to run the pathing tests.
<p>
<code>DebugGrid</code> provides you with code based on 
<a href="https://spritely.jovial.com/">Spritely</a> that can be used to
visualize a 2D grid of values.  Try it out, by changing the value of
<code>DebugGrid.ENABLED</code> to <code>true</code>.  <code>DebugGrid</code>
can be a valuable tool for visualizing the behavior of the more complicated
pathing algorithm you'll be developing next.  This is much like what you did
in <a href="../labs/lab08/instructions.html">Lab 8</a>.  Note that you can close the
debug window at any time.  If you do, the program will keep running.  Indeed,
it will run much more quickly, because it won't be generating a debugging 
animation.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>A* Pathing</h2>
</div>

<p>
Once you have <code>SingleStepPathing</code> working and integrated, define 
a new <code>PathingStrategy</code> subclass that implements 
the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search algorithm</a>.
As before, an entity will take only one step along the
computed path at a time.  The <code>computePath</code> method will be invoked
multiple times as the entity moves toward the intended destination.  
As such, take care if you maintain any state relevant to the algorithm.
<p>
The internal data structures of A* can be visualized on a fixed-size grid.  Take
advantage of this!  For each run of the A* pathing algorithm, you can display the
current internal state of the internal data structures by coloring the corresponding
grid in the <code>DebugGrid</code> according to which set that point is in.  Note that
it's a good idea to put such debugging code inside an if statement that checks if
debugging is enabled, like this:
<blockquote><pre>    if (Debug.ENABLED) {
        ...  Use the instance of DebugGrid
    }</pre></blockquote
<p>This is a good idea because the Java compiler will completely eliminate
the debug code if <code>Debug.ENABLED</code> is false.  Because of this,
you don't need to worry about your debugging code slowing down the program
when it's running normally.
<p>
When you implement A*, don't forget what you learned in previous CS
classes about data structures!  Pick data structures that are reasonably
efficient.  A couple of minutes perusing the different collection classes
in <code>java.util</code> to select an appropriate data structure can make
a big difference in performance.  Part of your grade will be based on speed.
<p>
<strong>Additional A* Requirements:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Your implementation of A* must be in a class called
    <code>AStarPathingStrategy</code>.
<li>It must have a zero-argument constructor.  This constructor
    will be used by the grader.
<li>The <code>heuristic_cost_estimate()</code> function from the A* algorithm
    must take two points and number of steps between the two (calculated
    with the <code>stepsFromTo</code> function).  It must be called 
    <code>double costEstimate(Point, Point, int)</code>, and 
    it must be protected.  The grader will create a subclass 
    of <code>AStarPathingStrategy</code> that overrides this method.
<li>The value returned by <code>costEstimate()</code> must be non-negative, and must
    not over-estimate the cost ignoring obstacles (given by
    <code>stepsFromTo()</code>) by more than 5%.  That is to say:
    <blockquote><code>costEstimate(p1, p2, stepsFromTo(p1, p2)) ≤ 1.05 * stepsFromTo(p1, p2)</code></blockquote>
    must be true.
</ul>
<p>
Hint:  When you get to thinking about algorithmic efficiency, it
will be help to think about how you can tweak the heuristic in ways that aren't
strictly related to how many steps there are between two points.
<p>
Your A* pathing strategy <strong>must be in 
a class called <code>AStarPathingStrategy</code></strong>,
and it <strong>must have a zero-argument constructor</strong>.  An automated
test will use this constructor.  The <code>checkgit</code> program will check to
make sure this class exists, that an instance can be created, that it can
subclass your class, and that it can override <code>costEstimate()</code>.

</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Testing A*</h3>
</div>

<p>
You are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for this strategy.  Since
your implementation must conform to a specified interface, part of the
grading will be based on instructor unit tests.  Remember, one of the goals
of this assignment is to make an implementation of A* that could be reused
in another program.Some things to consider
in writing the unit tests:
<ul>
<li>Does the pathing strategy contract specify how
    <code>canPassThrough</code> behaves when given the start
    point or the end point?
<li>What happens when the path is blocked?
<li>Can the same <code>PathingStragegy</code> object be
    used multiple times?  Is it required to be?
</ul>
<p>
You should write unit tests to make sure that your implementation of A* will work
in any program that follows the contract.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h3>Algorithm Efficiency</h3>
</div>
<p>
If time permits, you should explore one aspect of the efficiency of the
algorithm itself.  A common scenario in the miner program is for a path
to be relatively unobstructed.  Consider the <code>SIMPLE</code> test world,
in <code>TestPathing</code>:
<blockquote><pre>S.....
......
......
......
......
.....G</pre></blockquote>
<p>
How many of the grid squares does your A* algorithm visit to determine
a path in this very simple layout?  Can it be improved?  In order to
understand this, it can help a great deal to visualize the contents of
the open set and the closed set, relative to the start point, the goal
and the obstacles.  <code>DebugGrid</code> is already set up to help you
here.  Try using <code>DebugGrid</code> to understand how the A* algorithm
proceeds.
<p>
Given what you see on the <code>SIMPLE</code> layout, what would the
performance be like on an open 100x100 grid, with the start and goal in
opposite corners?
<p>
In order to improve the performance of the A* algorithm in the common case
of an open field, you can adjust the <code>costEstimate()</code> function.  
Be sure to obey the contract:  Don't exceed the number of steps by more than
5%, and never give a negative cost estimate.
<p>
A relatively small part of your grade will be based on the performance of your
algorithm on a large open grid.  Note that there are other areas where
algorithmic performance improvements could be explored, such as the behavior
when the path is obstructed.  In this assignment, you are not being asked
to explore these.  As noted before, obstructed paths are somewhat rare in the
miner program.
</p>
<div class="header">
<h3>Discussion:  Alternate Traversal Approaches</h3>
</div>

<p>
After completing the above, you might notice an indecisive miner
ping-ponging between two points.  This is an artifact of attempting
to move to the nearest ore and only following one step of any computed
path.  That one step moves the miner closer to a different ore, which
results in the computation of a new path ... that brings the miner
right back to the previous point.

<p>
Some alternatives are possible. Experimentation with and implementation of any of
these is entirely optional, and won't be graded, but it's interesting to
consider.  Any such changes would be in the entity code, not in the
pathing strategy itself.
</p>

<ul>
   <li>Non-fickle: Once a path is computed, continue to follow that path
      as long as the target entity (e.g., ore) has not been collected by
      another.  This approach skips the check for the "nearest target" as
      long as the previous target is available.
   <li>Determined: Once a path is computed, follow it to the end.  This
      approach skips the check for "nearest target" until a new path must
      be computed.
   <li>Ol' College Try: Once a path is computed, follow it at least
      X steps (or until exhausted) before giving up.  This approach
      skips the check for "nearest" target until it has consumed a fixed
      number of steps in the current path, or until it has consumed
      the entire path.  After this initial effort, if the destination has
      not been reached, then check for the "nearest target" and compute a
      new path.
</ul>

<p>
Of course, it is important to ensure that an implementation of any
of these alternate approaches takes care not to move into an occupied cell.  
Keep in mind that the path was clear when it was originally computed, but 
other entities may move so as to block the path.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Submission</h2>
</div>

<p>
Submit your program in <code>turninXXX/p5</code> to GitHub 
by midnight on the due date.  Java source files should go in
<code>turninXXX/p5/src</code>, and your documentation file
should be in <code>turninXXX/p5/doc</code>.  You'll probably want to
copy your <code>run.sh</code> file and the <code>images</code> directory to
<code>turninXXX/p5</code>, so you can do your work directly there.
When you submit the files to github, the image files won't be uploaded;
git has been configured to ignore them, in the file 
<code>turninXXX/.gitignore</code>.
<p>
If you'd like to submit the assignment one day late with a penalty of 5%, 
add a file called <code>late_5_percent_off.txt</code> to the 
<code>p5</code> directory.  If you'd like to submit the assignment two 
days late with a penalty of 15%, add a file called
<code>late_15_percent_off.txt</code> to the <code>p5</code>
directory.  Make sure you add and push the late file.
<p>
After your code is working and submitted,
check your submission using the <code>checkgit</code> command on the
unix server.  If the autograder can't find your files for a reason that
is caught by <code>checkgit</code>, you will get a zero on the assignment.  To
check your submission, on a Unix server type:
<blockquote><pre>checkgit &lt;git-login> 203 p5</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If it works, you will see the message "** Tests Passed **".  If not,
you will see some kind of error message.  The error message might not tell
you exactly what you need to change, but it should give an indication as
to what is wrong.
